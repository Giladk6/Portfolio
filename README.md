🧾 Professional Summary  
IT and System Administrator with over 10 years of experience in infrastructure and Linux systems. 
Over the past year, I have focused on transitioning into the DevOps field through intensive self-learning,  
completing multiple practical labs and projects using AWS, Jenkins, Docker, k8s, Helm, and Terraform.  
I’m now seeking my first official DevOps role where I can leverage my strong operational background  
and continue building real-world DevOps experience.
